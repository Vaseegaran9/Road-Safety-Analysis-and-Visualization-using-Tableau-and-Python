# Road-Safety-Analysis-and-Visualization-using-Tableau-and-Python
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize UK road accident data, to assess accident frequency, severity, and vehicle types. It explores correlations with weather, road conditions and geospatial patterns, contributing to data-driven strategies for safer UK roads using Tableau and Python.

Using the road accident data set from Kaggle the data visualization has been done by comparing through various years and the severity level of accidents through the filter.
